# HolocronDB

A simple key value store that I personally use for learning rust and getting
comfortable with its learning curve, including concurrency support, borrowing
and whatnot. Will be a part of a larger project soon.


## Try it out!

1. Clone using SSH

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:Skeletrox/HolocronDB.git
```

2. Build the project

```bash
$ cd HolocronDB
$ cargo build
```

3. Run the server first

```bash
$ target/debug/kvs_server
```

4. Run the client

```bash
$ target/debug/kvs_client
```

5. Type `h` for help within the client.
